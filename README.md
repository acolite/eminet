# About EMINET
EMINET is the EMIssivity neural NET to derive thermal emissivity from multispectral VSWIR surface reflectance developed at RBINS. The network is trained on resampled ECOSTRESS data and can at present derive emissivity for Landsat 8/TIRS bands (B10 and B11) from the multispectral Landsat 8/OLI data (B1-7). The method and validation is presented in Vanhellemont, 2020 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2020.06.007).

EMINET development was funded by the Belgian Science Policy Office BRAIN-be program under contract BR/165/A1/MICROBIAN.

EMINET is provided by RBINS as an experimental tool, without explicit or implied warranty. Use of the program is at your own discretion and risk.
